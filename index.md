## Tabby OS
Merging Touchscreen and Desktop



Tabby OS will be bringing a touchscreen and desktop envoirment into one OS with a clean and simple interface



Version 0.15 will be coming soon


## Why is it called Tabby OS
I own a Tabby cat Simon who sings to his toys (Im not joking he does that when im not around) and I just based the OS on him
